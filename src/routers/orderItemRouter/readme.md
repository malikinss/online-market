# `orderItemRouter.js`

## Description 📝

This Express.js router module defines routes for managing order items.
It provides functionality for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting order item records in a system.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this module is to expose RESTful API routes that handle order item operations.
These routes allow the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of order items, enabling efficient management of order-related data.

## How It Works 🔍

-   **POST /**: Creates a new order item record.
-   **GET /**: Retrieves a list of all order item records.
-   **GET /:id**: Retrieves a specific order item by its ID.
-   **PUT /:id**: Updates an order item by its ID.
-   **DELETE /:id**: Deletes an order item by its ID.

## Output 📜

-   Successful requests will return the created order item, all order items, or the updated order item.
-   Error responses will return an appropriate HTTP status code and error message, especially if an order item is not found or if there's an issue with the request.

## Usage 📦

1. Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install express
    ```
2. Import and use the router in your main app file:
    ```javascript
    const orderItemRouter = require("./path/to/orderItemRouter");
    app.use("/order-item", orderItemRouter);
    ```
3. Ensure that the following methods are defined in the `OrderItemController`:
    - `createRecord`: For creating a new order item.
    - `getRecords`: For retrieving all order items.
    - `getRecord`: For retrieving a specific order item by ID.
    - `updateRecord`: For updating an order item by ID.
    - `deleteRecord`: For deleting an order item by ID.

## Conclusion 🚀

This router module provides a simple and organized way to manage order items within an application.
It offers core CRUD operations, allowing for efficient management of order item data, and can be easily integrated into larger systems for order processing and management.
