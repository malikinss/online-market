# `paymentRouter.js`

## Description 📝

This Express.js router module provides routes for managing payment records. It includes functionality for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting payment information by ID.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this module is to offer RESTful API endpoints for handling payments in a system.
It allows for creating new payments, retrieving payment details, updating existing records, and deleting payment information by ID.

## How It Works 🔍

-   **POST /**: Creates a new payment record.
-   **GET /:id**: Retrieves a specific payment record by its ID.
-   **PUT /:id**: Updates a specific payment record by its ID.
-   **DELETE /:id**: Deletes a payment record by its ID.

## Output 📜

-   Successful requests will return the created payment record, the requested payment data, or the updated payment record.
-   Error responses will return the appropriate HTTP status code and error message, particularly if the payment record does not exist or an invalid ID is provided.

## Usage 📦

1. Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install express
    ```
2. Import and use the router in your main app file:
    ```javascript
    const paymentRouter = require("./path/to/paymentRouter");
    app.use("/payment", paymentRouter);
    ```
3. Ensure the following methods are defined in the `PaymentController`:
    - `createRecord`: For creating a new payment record.
    - `getRecord`: For retrieving a payment record by ID.
    - `updateRecord`: For updating a payment record by ID.
    - `deleteRecord`: For deleting a payment record by ID.
